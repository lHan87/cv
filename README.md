# CV, News & some professional things

I am a final year PhD candidate, affiliated with ADAPT research Centre, DCU. I just submitted my PhD thesis for examination with the topic on ''investigation into Multi-word Expressions in Machine Translation'', supervised by Prof Gareth Jones and Prof Alan Smeaton. I am open to new opptunities and positions, so get in touch if you are interested. 

My Acadamic background: BSc. in Math 2007-2011 (GPA 80/100); MSc. in Software Engineering 2011-2014 (Excellent Graduation Award); PhD candidate in Language and Computation 2014-2016 (in ILLC Amsterdam, then I moved); PhD candidate in Computer Application 2016-2021 (NLP, graduating).

My research background: 
Joined NLP2CT lab from 2011-2014, worked on statistical natural language processing (NLP) including word segmentation, entity recognition, syntactic constituency parsing, machine translation, translation evaluation, and some corpus thing (multi-lingual treebanks tagset mapping). 
Joined ILLC 2014-2016, worked on statistical paraphrasing model construction, translation evaluation, just before I got a year full-time sick-leave, then I moved to Ireland. 
Joined ADAPT centre 2016-now, worked on some survey of ontology based MT, then MT from comparable corpora, then finally some experimental investigation on multi-word expressions in neural MT (NMT), and Chinese character decomposition for NMT.
